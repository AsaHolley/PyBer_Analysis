# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer Analysis ##
The purpose of this project was to create a summary DataFrame of Pyber ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
**This project used the following resources:** Pythonic code, Jupyter notebook, csv based resources, the Pandas software library, and Matplotlib
**Code can be found here:** [Code in Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/AsaHolley/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

## Results ##
As the below line chart shows it is clear that most Pyber Fares come from Urban Cities with total fares by city average between $1500 and $2500 during the January to April time frame. This is in stark contrast to the total fares in rural cities that never break the $500 total over the same time frame. The chart also shows that fares begin to show an upward trend in Suburban cities starting in early April while Urban fares level off and rural fairs begin to decline.  Fares in all three city times show a quick spike towards the end of February, which could be indicative of a holiday or special occasion in the area of the country Pyber is operating.

## Summary ##
**Recommendation 1-** Pyber should focus on building its business in its most high fare city types- namely the urban cities and to a lesser extend suburban cities. Rural area's do not produce substational revenue. 

**Recommendation 2-** It appears that is a trend in the Spring towards increasing ridership in suburban areas and a decrease in Urban. Pyber should build marketing strategies around this trend to take advantage.

**Recommendation 3-**
